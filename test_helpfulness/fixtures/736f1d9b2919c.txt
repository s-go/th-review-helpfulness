Its a nice bag if you don't have larger lenses.  Its rated to hold 1-2 bodies and 7-10 lenses.  I currently have a 40D/grip, 580EX II, 70-200 f/2.8L, 28-135IS, and then tamrons 28-70 2.8 and 17-35 lenses.  thats full to the max.  I contacted Canon to find out what lenses it was rated for, they considered the 17-35 lens even to be larger than what it was designed for.  They designed it and rated it for two bodies, no grips, no external flashes, and the lenses are all small prime lenses like the 28, 24, and 50mm's.  They couldnt list 10 different focal length lenses that would fit in the bag. so why do they say that?  I had to special order this bag from my shop, so there are no returns, and Canon is sticking to their word that it holds what they say so they are doing anything about it either. If you can live with the camera/grip, flash and 4 lenses, then its a great bag, but if you are getting it to hold anywhere near the gear its rated for, go with something else.  If anyone wants mine, just email me. im selling it on here for cheap now.
